Most of the cases, companies have business data on their databases and when they can't integrate their database with their current analytics solution,
it makes harder for them to keep track of their custom metrics reliably. Rakam allows you to integrate your databases 
so that you can join the data between your databases and the event data-set in Rakam.

Currently we support Mysql, Postgresql, Mssql and remote CSV and JSON files, you can plug the databases and files as Rakam schemas
and reference it in your SQL queries.
