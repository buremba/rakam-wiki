You can import your offline data via our bulk uploader. Currently we support CSV, JSON and AVRO formats,
you can upload the files directly from your computer or specify the remote URLs so that Rakam can fetch the files and import it automatically for you.

You may use [the API](http://api.rakam.io/#collect-bulk-events) to import the data or use [Rakam UI](http://app.rakam.io/cÄ±rrent/settings/import-export/) in order to interact with the API.
